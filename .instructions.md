# AI Agent Instructions for Codex-K0

## Project Overview

**Codex-K0** is an AI Agent Memory Bank System designed to provide perfect context continuity across sessions. This
project serves as both a template and a working implementation of comprehensive documentation frameworks.

## Mandatory Session Protocol

### 1. Initialize Context (ALWAYS FIRST)

```text
1. Read AGENTS.md for lifecycle protocols
2. Read ALL Memory Bank files in order:
   - projectbrief.md → productContext.md → systemPatterns.md
   - techContext.md → activeContext.md → progress.md
3. Review .clinerules for project-specific intelligence
4. Check activeContext.md for current work state
```

### 2. Work Execution

- Update `activeContext.md` before starting new work
- Follow established patterns and cross-references
- Use `[TO BE DEFINED]` for incomplete information
- Maintain consistency with existing documentation style

### 3. Session Completion

- Document changes in `progress.md`
- Update relevant Memory Bank files if project scope changes
- Ensure all placeholders are properly marked
- Validate with markdownlint script before finalizing

## Key Capabilities

### Memory Bank Management

- **Read**: Always consume full Memory Bank context before work
- **Update**: Maintain cross-references and consistency
- **Evolve**: Document learnings and patterns
- **Validate**: Use scripts for quality assurance

### Script Development

- Focus on automation, error handling, and cross-platform support
- Follow the markdownlint.sh pattern for comprehensive scripts
- Include logging, dependency management, and CI/CD compatibility
- Test in multiple modes (interactive, silent, check-only)

### Documentation Standards

- Clear purpose statements for every file
- Self-instructive content (no external guidance needed)
- Comprehensive cross-referencing
- Placeholder system for future completion

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Context Completeness**: Never work without full Memory Bank context
2. **Self-Instruction**: All work must be documented for future sessions
3. **Quality Standards**: Use available validation tools
4. **Evolution Tracking**: Document what works, what doesn't, and why

## Project-Specific Intelligence

### File Relationships

- Memory Bank files form a hierarchy (foundation → implementation → current state)
- Scripts support the development workflow with automation
- Configuration files enable quality assurance and git integration

### Common Patterns

- Bash scripts with comprehensive error handling
- Markdown documentation with clear structure
- Cross-platform compatibility for all tools
- Automated dependency management where possible

### Quality Gates

- All markdown must pass linting
- Scripts must work in headless environments
- Documentation must be self-sufficient
- Git integration must exclude temporary files

## Learning Integration

This project continuously evolves based on real-world usage. Document:

- Patterns that work well for AI agent continuity
- Challenges encountered in context persistence
- Improvements to the Memory Bank system
- Successful automation strategies

**Remember**: The Memory Bank is your single source of truth. Every session begins fresh, so the Memory Bank must contain
everything needed for perfect context restoration.
