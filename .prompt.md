# AI Agent Prompt Template

When working on the Codex-K0 Memory Bank System, use this prompt structure:

## Context Loading Prompt

```text
I'm working on the Codex-K0 Memory Bank System. Before starting any work:

1. Please read ALL Memory Bank files in this order:
   - AGENTS.md (protocols)
   - memory-bank/projectbrief.md (foundation)
   - memory-bank/productContext.md (purpose)
   - memory-bank/systemPatterns.md (architecture)
   - memory-bank/techContext.md (implementation)
   - memory-bank/activeContext.md (current state)
   - memory-bank/progress.md (evolution)

2. Review .clinerules for project intelligence

3. Check current task context in activeContext.md

Please confirm you've loaded the full Memory Bank context before proceeding with: [YOUR SPECIFIC TASK]
```

## Task-Specific Prompts
