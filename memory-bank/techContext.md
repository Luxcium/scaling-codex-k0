## Instructions for AI Agents

**When this file is incomplete:**

1. Examine package.json, requirements.txt, or similar dependency files
2. Analyze existing code to identify technologies in use
3. Document setup procedures based on project structure
4. Update with technologies as they're introduced

**When making technical choices:**

- Reference this file for consistency with established stack
- Document new technology introductions with rationale
- Consider compatibility with existing technical constraints
- Validate against performance and security requirements

**This file enables:**

- Consistent technology choices across features
- Proper development environment setup
- Effective onboarding of new developers
- Technical debt management and optimization

**Update triggers:**

- Introduction of new technologies or frameworks
- Changes to development environment or setup
- Updates to dependencies or external services
- Modifications to build, test, or deployment processes
- Discovery of new technical constraints or requirements
