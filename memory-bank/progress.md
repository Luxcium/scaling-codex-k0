## Instructions for AI Agents

**This file's purpose:**

- Track overall project evolution and status
- Document what's working vs. what needs work
- Provide historical context for decision making
- Identify patterns in project development

**Update frequency:**

- After completing major features or milestones
- When significant bugs are fixed or issues resolved
- When architecture or technology decisions change
- During project review or retrospective sessions

**When updating this file:**

1. Move completed items from "what's left" to "what's working"
2. Update status indicators and progress metrics
3. Document any decision changes with rationale
4. Add new insights or learnings to evolution sections
5. Update blockers and known issues as they're resolved

**This file informs:**

- Project planning and prioritization decisions
- Technical debt management strategies
- User communication about project status
- Historical context for future decision making

**Cross-references:**

- activeContext.md (current immediate work)
- All Memory Bank files (specific domain progress)
- .clinerules (project-specific patterns and learnings)

**Critical for:**

- Understanding project health and trajectory
- Making informed decisions about future work
- Communicating progress to stakeholders
