# Active Context

> **CURRENT WORK DOCUMENT** - Current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions. This is the most frequently updated file and reflects immediate work state.

## Current Focus

**Primary Task:** Memory Bank Template Generation and Initialization

**Active Work:**

- Creating comprehensive Memory Bank structure with self-instructive templates
- Establishing complete documentation system for AI agent continuity
- Updating .clinerules with enhanced project intelligence patterns

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1. Complete remaining core Memory Bank files (activeContext.md, progress.md)
2. Update .clinerules with Memory Bank usage patterns and project intelligence
3. Verify all cross-references between Memory Bank files are accurate
4. Ensure templates are fully self-instructive for any AI agent
5. Add environment detection and markdown lint scripts for CI/CD readiness

## Recent Changes

**Files Created/Modified:**

- `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Foundation document template with AI agent instructions
- `memory-bank/productContext.md` - Product purpose and user experience template
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns template
- `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Technical implementation context template
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Current work tracking template
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - Project evolution and status template
- `.clinerules` - Enhanced with Memory Bank implementation patterns
- `README.md` - Comprehensive project overview and usage guidelines
- `scripts/README.md` - Descriptions for environment and lint scripts
- `scripts/env-info.sh` - Environment detection utility
- `scripts/markdownlint.sh` - Markdown linting helper

**Key Decisions Made:**

- Memory Bank structure follows hierarchical dependency model (projectbrief → others → activeContext → progress)
- Each file includes comprehensive AI agent instructions for self-guidance
- Templates use [TO BE DEFINED] placeholders for easy identification of incomplete sections
- Cross-reference system established between related files

## Active Considerations

**Architecture Decisions:**

- Memory Bank files are interdependent but avoid duplication
- Each file has specific purpose and clear boundaries
- Templates include update triggers and cross-reference guidance
- Self-instructive design enables any AI agent to pick up work seamlessly

**Implementation Patterns:**

- All templates include "Instructions for AI Agents" sections
- Update triggers are explicitly documented
- Cross-references maintain consistency across files
- Version control integration assumed for change tracking

## Important Context

**Project Intelligence Insights:**

- User emphasizes complete, self-instructive documentation
- Memory persistence is critical due to AI agent memory resets
- Templates must be explicit and comprehensive
- .clinerules serves as learning journal for project-specific patterns

**User Preferences:**

- Comprehensive documentation over minimal approaches
- Self-instructive templates that don't require external guidance
- Explicit instruction integration for AI agent workflows
- Complete gesture creation rather than incremental builds

## Current State Assessment

**Completed:**

- All 6 core Memory Bank files created with comprehensive templates
- Each file includes self-instructive AI agent guidance sections
- Hierarchical structure established with clear dependencies
- Template placeholders clearly marked for future completion
- .clinerules updated with Memory Bank implementation patterns
- Cross-reference system verified across all files
- README.md created with complete project overview and usage guidelines
- Full Memory Bank template system ready for deployment

**Current State:**

- Complete Memory Bank template system operational and documented
- All files follow self-instructive design principles
- Templates ready for any AI agent to use immediately
- Project intelligence patterns documented in .clinerules
- Initial environment detection and markdown lint scripts added for CI/CD readiness
- Comprehensive README provides clear onboarding and usage instructions
- System ready for real-world project implementation

**Next Actions for Future Sessions:**

- Use Memory Bank templates to define actual project scope and goals
- Replace [TO BE DEFINED] placeholders with concrete project information
- Begin actual project implementation using Memory Bank workflow
- Test Memory Bank effectiveness with real project work
- Validate template system with concrete development tasks

## Instructions for AI Agents

**This file's purpose:**

- Track immediate work state and current focus
- Document active decisions and considerations
- Provide context for continuing interrupted work
- Bridge between planning and implementation

**Update frequency:**

- Before starting new tasks or major work sessions
- After completing significant work or making key decisions
- When switching between different areas of focus
- When discovering important project insights or patterns

**When updating this file:**

1. Document what work is currently active or was just completed
2. Record any important decisions or insights discovered
3. Update next steps based on current state
4. Note any blockers or dependencies
5. Capture user preferences or patterns observed

**This file connects to:**

- progress.md (overall project status and evolution)
- All other Memory Bank files (provides current context for their updates)
- .clinerules (project-specific intelligence and patterns)

**Critical for:**

- Resuming work after memory resets
- Understanding current project state
- Making informed decisions about next steps
- Maintaining context continuity across sessions
