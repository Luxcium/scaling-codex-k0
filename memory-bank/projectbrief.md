## Instructions for AI Agents

**When this file is incomplete:**

1. Gather requirements from user interactions
2. Define project scope based on user needs
3. Update this file with concrete details
4. Ensure all other Memory Bank files align with this foundation

**When updating:**

- Only change scope if explicitly requested by user
- Maintain consistency across all Memory Bank files
- Document any scope changes with reasoning

**This file drives:**

- productContext.md (why the project exists)
- systemPatterns.md (how it should be built)
- techContext.md (what technologies to use)
- All downstream planning and implementation decisions
